## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## This is my code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of *embedded code*. You can embed **code** like this:

## Mean

```{r}
mean(3,4, 8,9,0,1,2,5,6,7)
```

## Median

```{r}
median(6,7,8,9,1,2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

> The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

$x^2 + 3x +8$
